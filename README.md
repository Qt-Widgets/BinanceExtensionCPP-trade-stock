# Intro 

This library is an extension for the API of Binance. It is used to help write trading algorithms on Binance. 
The design is delibaretly attempting to reduce 'thinking' during runtime, by using clever methods such as CRTP and the 'Params' object. 
No virtual classes/methods are used in this library.

# Dependencies

	1. JsonCPP https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp
	2. CURL 
	3. Boost/Beast websockets https://github.com/boostorg/beast

These 3 must be present in order to use the library.


# Documentation
You must initialize a client object, which is one of the following: [SpotClient, FuturesClientUSDT, FuturesClientCoin]

## Exchange client
If the client is not public, api-key and api-secret must be passed in std::string format to the constructor.
<br />Futures clients may be declared in testnet mode by using the method "set_testnet_mode(bool)". Spot
- #### Exceptions
	WIP
- #### CRTP implementation
	Clients
- #### Notes
		1. Default arguments are not allowed with threads. The argument must be specified

## REST client
- #### 'Params' object
	WIP
- #### Response type
	Each REST request returns a JSON type objet, that holds the three following keys:
    1. "response" = Actual response from the exchange in string format.
    2. "code" = HTTP status code of the request.
    3. "parse_status" = Returns a string generated by the JSON parser, containing parsing errors (if any)
- #### Notes
   		 1. Default arguments are not allowed with threads. The argument must be specified
## Websocket client
- #### Callback functor
	WIP
- #### Notes
		1. Default arguments are not allowed with threads. The argument must be specified
		2. When passing a symbol as an argument to a stream starter, the symbol must be lower case.

### Optimizations
For Microsoft compilers set the following flags for better runtime performance:
* Optimization: /O2
* Instrinsic functions: /Oi
* Favor speed: /Ot
* Frame pointers: /Oy (if available)

# Examples
* orderbook_manager.cpp = Connecting to a symbol orderbook and fetching live data + getting initial snap via REST (not thread-safe).


# Lined up
* constexpr for endpoints + api base after the release of c++20 (support for constexpr and std::string)
